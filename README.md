Hackathon with my dear friend Jason! JQuery, Angular, Javascript, RESTful API, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap.

Built a fun, simple web application where two random fighters from Star Wars universe, and Marvel universe COLLIDE! Completed in 24 hours.
Great use of Angular/JavaScript's logic, and fun to interact with thanks to Bootstrap and Jquery Effects and Modals.
